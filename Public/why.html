<div class="title"><h1>Why Take the Pledge</h1>
<h2>"Why is everything only for the Christian kids? Why is there never anything for us?"</h2>
<p>A few years ago my daughter asked me that and I knew I had to do something. Nearly 30% of the American population identifies as non-Christian,
but walk around the mall in December and you wouldn't know it. It is very hard to explain to those not personally affected by it how isolating
and hurtful it is to feel unwelcome in public spaces that you must enter to go about your necessary daily business. This is especially true of 
children who don't understand that they are ignored, not out spite, but usually just out of a lack of knowledge. I began this movement as a letter
writing campaign a few years ago in an attempt to provide that missing knowledge and create a more welcoming environment for families like mine.
Unfortunately, in the last year, the situation has gotten worse for non-Christian families. Hate crimes against minorities, expecially religious
minorities, rapidly increased by 500% last winter. It is no longer a question of whether our familes are welcome in a specific store, the question
is now, "Are we safe?"</p>
<h2>"It's just easier [and safer] to stay home."</h2>
<p>It is always frustrating to me when my fellow non-Christians would rather stay home than ask a business to make changes to make them feel more 
welcome. It's true that almost everything can be bought online, and while that may seem like an immediate solution, it doesn't allow us to be a 
part of the community. It is my hope that businesses would rather reach out to those people who feel forced to shop exclusively online and bring 
their business back into their stores, than loose such a large portion of the population from their customer base. There are many ways to find out
what cultural symbols you can incorperate into your displays to include all the different religious and secular traditions in your area, such as 
looking at local cenus data, or doing a survey of your current customers. If researching many different holidays seems complicated, another option 
is to keep displays secular. The important thing is to listen to your customers (and employees) to make sure they feel included and safe.</p></div>
